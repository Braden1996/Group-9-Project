\section{Conclusion}
	Overall we have made significant progress towards our goal of a fully working system. However we still have requirements which have not been met, and we will continue to work on thing to ensure that they are.\\
	We have done this by sticking closely to our work plan to keep track of what has been completed, and what still needs to be. This has enabled us to change and update our plans to ensure we are able to meet all the goal we have set for ourselves.\\
	We plan to continue this into the next stage of project development to meet our final goals.\\
