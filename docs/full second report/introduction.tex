\section{Introduction}

	The CAMEL project is an e-learning system for mathematics that has been developed by Cardiff School of Mathematics. It allows staff to upload theorems, examples, exercises, tests and homework for students to be able to read and complete either in their own time or before deadlines. \\\\
	We have been able to overhaul the system to bug fix the codebase which was given to us, improve efficiency, and resolve multiple technical issues. We have also been able to look at the way students and lecturers interact with the system and improve the implementation of the system based on this.
