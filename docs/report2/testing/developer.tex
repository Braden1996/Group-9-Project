The system is largely coded using django, so from a developer's perspective testing will be carried out with django’s built in unit testing functions. This will allow testing the code to become easier and more efficient. However so far in the software development cycle, for the bug fixes which we have implemented (See Appendix 2) we are unable to use these tools, although we will be using these to test once additions to the system have been made.\\

The testing which has been carried out will ensure each module does its task as expected before we move onto the next, reducing the likelihood of issues rearing up later down the line. Furthermore these unit tests will make any re-factoring done later less likely to affect the system's behaviour unexpectedly.\\
