	\subsubsection*{Introduction}
		As expected during the development of any large system, we must produce solutions towards the many proposed sub-problems in which are collectively required for the entirety system to function correctly.
		
		Although the thinking required for some of these problems is rather trivial, that is not the case for every problem identified during the development of our system... In fact, we encountered several problems which required comprehensive study, along with thinking in conscientious manner, in order to formulate a robust solution.
		
		Throughout the remainder of this subsection, we shall discuss the problems which we encountered, along with our solutions to said problems - provided in formats such as structured english and pseudocode.
