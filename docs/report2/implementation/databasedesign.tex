\subsection{Database Design}
	The current model that was provided with the current build of CAMEL will be used with the same naming structure, except additional modifications will be made with some models and new models will be added. Changes to the current models will be done to ensure that additional functionality can work correctly. Such example of a major change that have been implemented has occurred from the introduction new parser. This parser modifies the BookNode model by removing Mpath, as it is not longer required. The main aim of the changes to the database it to ensure compatibility with newer functionality, though it will not have a large impact for usability with the new system.\\
