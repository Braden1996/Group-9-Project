\subsection{Revised Requirements}
	For the development of CAMEL we have decided to revise some of the existing requirements that we proposed in the first report. We have decided to change a few of the requirements as we have decided to go with a different approach to development than we originally intended in the first report.\\
	
	\textbf{New Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item New parser implementation
		\item Re-factoring of existing codebase
	\end{itemize}
