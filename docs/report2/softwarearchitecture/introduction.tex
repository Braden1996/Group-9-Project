\subsection{Revised Requirements}
	For the development of CAMEL we have decided to revise some of the existing requirements that we proposed in the first report. We have decided to change a few of the requirements as we have decided to go with a different approach to development than we originally intended in the first report. As a group, we have decided to remake the CAMEL system from scratch to not only allow natural implementation of many of the requirements such as error handling, Python3 and maintainable code. This ensures that the system has support for clear and efficient code throughout, but allows easy integration of any future applications into CAMEL.\\    
	
	\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
	\textbf{Continuing Functional Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Provide Error handling and exception handling: This requirement will be continued and considered from the ground up with the new code base that we are currently developing. With the code that has been considered so far, error handling has already been applied.  
		\item Provide Unit Tests of code: Unit tests are currently in the stage of being implemented soon and will also occur naturally as we develop the CAMEL system. 
		\item Add methods to compare student answers: We have decided to continue to support this requirement as we believe that many of the changes that we are making to CAMEL will allow for easy integration of this functionality. This will be a property of CAMEL that will be added at the end as the code base refactoring is currently the main priority.    
		\item Logging of student answers: With the new code base under development, this functionality will be continued as we believe that this can be easily integrated when implementation of the homework application is included. Submitted and saved answers will be saved to the database. 
		\item Include deadlines in tests: Another piece of functionality that we will be carrying on with. This will be implemented and factored in when the homework application is refactored. The deadline will be displayed on screen and if a student does not complete the test, a message will be included.    
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Dropped Functional Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Provide functionality of enrolled modules for students: We decided to drop this requirement as it would only be a proof of concept rather than something that we can included into the system. We have decided to focus on items that we can implement rather than have development time spent on items that cannot be fully implemented.  
	\end{itemize}
		
	\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
	\textbf{New Non-Functional Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item New parser implementation: One of the main additions that we decided to tackle with the next build for CAMEL was the introduction of a new parser. We decided that this needed to be included as the current parser had a few flaws when it came to creating the HTML, plus required the entire database entry of the book to be re-added to included. In our current build, a new parser has been included that allows for new latex markup to be introduced relatively quickly, while keeping the code maintainable which was not present in the original build.    
		\item Re-factoring of existing codebase: To allow for the requirements of Python3, implementability and error handling, we have also decided to re-code much of the existing code to improve the quality and efficiency of it. By having all new code written, it also allows the integrations of the new parser to be implemented without causing compatibility issues. In our current build of CAMEL you can see the newly introduced code that is being add, which meets current requirements.  
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Continuing Non-Functional Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Documentation for developer
		\item System permissions
		\item Maintainable code
		\item Breakdown of core application
		\item Python3 Upgrade
		\item Improve navigation
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Dropped Non-Functional Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fix bugs with current system	
	\end{itemize}
