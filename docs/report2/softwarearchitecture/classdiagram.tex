\subsection{Class Diagram}
	\subsubsection{Introduction}
		In many cases, it is desirable to visualise the components of a particular system. This is done to create a better understanding of the role for the various components and how they relate to one-another.
		
		The standard convention for these visualisations is through the use of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams.
		
		Below is a UML diagram which represents the current system. However, please note, to avoid over-complicating the diagram, we have not included the diagram components for many of the objects provided by Django - unless absolutely necessary.
