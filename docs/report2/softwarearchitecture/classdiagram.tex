\subsection{Class Diagram}
	\subsubsection{Introduction}
		In many cases, it is desirable to visualise the components of a particular system. This is done to create a better understanding of the role for each of the various components and how they relate to one-another.
		
		The standard convention for these visualisations is through the use of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. UML provides us with a globally accepted, well-known approach to constructing a diagram of a software system. 
		
		Due to our system's reliance on Django, it is rather infeasible, and unnecessary, of us to construct a diagram for the system as a whole; as it would only really be useful if we recursed into Django's objects.
		
		However, as it happens, the \LaTeX Parser has no direct need to be coupled with Django, so it makes sense to design a diagram to illustrate how we intend the parser to look.
