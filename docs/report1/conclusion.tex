\section{Conclusion}
As we have a large range of requirements to add to the existing codebase, we have decided the priorities of each of these requirements and have made a plan of when we will be able to implement them. We have also created a risk map of carrying out these requirements efficiently, and will be prepared for any effects of these risks. 
We have chosen agile development as it is suited to our project and have created a gantt chart to map which team member will be able to do which requirement following the agile development plans. 
To ensure we follow legal, ethical, and social guidelines we have outlined them so that our end product will be of a high quality which breaks no laws and will not offend or raise issues with the users of the system.

By finishing this report it will allow us to efficiently progress with our project and make adjustments to the system to the best of our ability to give a end product of a high standard, following the guidelines our client has given us.
