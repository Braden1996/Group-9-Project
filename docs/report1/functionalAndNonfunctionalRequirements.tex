\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Functional \& Nonfunctional Requirements} % adds next line to the TOC (Table of Contents) and links it to a section called "Functional...ect"
\subsection*{Functional \& Nonfunctional Requirements} % \subsection*{title} makes a subsection called "title" that isn't added to the TOC (I've done it like this so subsections aren't numbered, I can just do \subsection{x} to get a subsection that would be labeled II.1, I'd have to renew a command like \renewcommand{\thesubsection}{\Roman{subsection}} to make it labelled as II.I)
