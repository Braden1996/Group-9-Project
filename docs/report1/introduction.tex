The CAMEL project is a prototype e-learning system for mathematics that has been developed by Cardiff School of Mathematics. The existing codebases needs a complete overhaul: documentation, exception handling, unit test and logging are currently non-existent and there are several technical issues to resolve. The way in which students and teachers might interact with the system should also be investigated and the design would be modified accordingly. 

	If the systems are implemented successfully, extensive data in student engagement will become available, which offers the possibility of analyzing patterns of student engagement and collaboration. The project should consider how such information might be extracted and visualized in a useful way.
